/**
 * This application introduces basic concepts of using an ORM, in this case
 * Hibernate, as a JPA provider.
 * <p>
 * The main class demonstrates how to create, find, update, detach, reattach,
 * and remove instances of the Book entity using JPA. It also shows how to use
 * the getReference method to obtain a reference to an entity without
 * immediately
 * loading it from the database.
 * <p>
 * To run this application, ensure you have the necessary dependencies for JPA
 * and Hibernate in your project. The example uses an in-memory H2 database
 * for simplicity, but you can configure it to use any other database by
 * changing
 * the JDBC URL and driver in the persistence.xml file.
 * <p>
 * An example persistence.xml file is provided below, which should be placed in
 * the src/main/resources/META-INF directory of your project. This file defines
 * the persistence unit and the properties required to connect to the database.
 * 
 * <pre>{@code 
 * <?xml version="1.0" encoding="UTF-8"?> 
 * <persistence xmlns="http://xmlns.jcp.org/xml/ns/persistence"
 *           xmlns:xsi="http://www.w3.org/2001/XMLSchema-instance"
 *           xsi:schemaLocation="http://xmlns.jcp.org/xml/ns/persistence
 *           http://xmlns.jcp.org/xml/ns/persistence/persistence_2_1.xsd"
 *           version="2.1">
 *  <persistence-unit name="library_persistence_unit">
 *      <class>com.mycompany.app.entities.Book</class>
 *      <properties>
 *          <property name="jakarta.persistence.jdbc.driver" value=
"org.h2.Driver"/>
 *          <property name="jakarta.persistence.jdbc.url" value=
"jdbc:h2:mem:test;DB_CLOSE_DELAY=-1"/>
 *          <property name="jakarta.persistence.jdbc.user" value="sa"/>
 *          <property name="jakarta.persistence.jdbc.password" value=""/>
 *          <property name="hibernate.hbm2ddl.auto" value="create-drop"/>
 *          <property name="hibernate.dialect" value=
"org.hibernate.dialect.H2Dialect"/>
 *      </properties>
 *  </persistence-unit> 
 * </persistence>
 * }</pre>
 * 
 * <p>
 * The example uses an in-memory H2 database, which is suitable for testing and
 * development purposes.
 * <p>
 * Ensure you have the necessary dependencies in your pom.xml or build.gradle
 * file
 * for JPA and Hibernate.
 * For example, if you are using Maven (pom.xml), example dependencies would be:
 * 
 * <pre>{@code
 * <dependency>
 *    <groupId>org.hibernate</groupId>
 *    <artifactId>hibernate-core</artifactId>
 *    <version>5.4.32.Final</version>
 * </dependency>
 * <dependency>
 *    <groupId>org.hibernate</groupId>
 *    <artifactId>hibernate-entitymanager</artifactId>
 *    <version>5.4.32.Final</version>
 * </dependency>
 * <dependency>
 *    <groupId>com.h2database</groupId>
 *    <artifactId>h2</artifactId>
 *    <version>1.4.200</version>
 *    <scope>runtime</scope>
 * </dependency>
 * <dependency>
 *    <groupId>jakarta.persistence</groupId>
 *    <artifactId>jakarta.persistence-api</artifactId>
 *    <version>2.2.3</version>
 * </dependency>
 *}</pre>
 *
 * <p>
 * Or, if you are using Gradle (build.gradle), dependencies would
 * be:
 * 
 * <pre>{@code
 *   dependencies {
 *     implementation 'org.hibernate.orm:hibernate-core:6.4.4.Final'
 *     implementation 'jakarta.persistence:jakarta.persistence-api:3.1.0'
 *     // Add your JDBC driver as needed, e.g. for H2:
 *     runtimeOnly 'com.h2database:h2:2.2.224'
 *     // ...other dependencies...
 *   }
 * }</pre>
 * <p>
 * The above dependencies are examples and may need to be adjusted based on
 * your project setup. Make sure to adjust the versions according to your
 * project setup and requirements.
 * <p>
 * You can also use a different database by changing the JDBC URL and driver
 * in the persistence.xml file.
 * For example, to use MySQL, you would change the JDBC URL to:
 * 
 * <pre>{@code
 * <property name="jakarta.persistence.jdbc.url" value=
 * "jdbc:mysql://localhost:3306/mydb"/>
 * }</pre>
 * 
 * Or, if using PostgreSQL, you would change the JDBC URL to:
 * 
 * <pre>{@code
 * <property name="jakarta.persistence.jdbc.url" value=
 * "jdbc:postgresql://localhost:5432/mydb"/>
 * }
 * </pre>
 * 
 * <p>
 * The JDBC driver for MySQL or PostgreSQL must also be included in your
 * project dependencies.
 * For example, if you are using MySQL, you would add a dependency
 * 
 * <pre>{@code
 * <dependency>
 *    <groupId>mysql</groupId>
 *    <artifactId>mysql-connector-java</artifactId>
 *    <version>8.0.26</version>
 * </dependency>
 * }</pre>
 * 
 * or in a Gradle build script (build.gradle), you would add:
 * 
 * <pre>{@code
 * dependencies {
 *  runtimeOnly 'mysql:mysql-connector-java:8.0.26'
 * }
 * }</pre>
 *
 * <p>
 * If PostgreSQL is your choice, you would add the PostgreSQL driver
 * dependency in your pom.xml like this:
 * *
 * 
 * <pre>{@code
 * <dependency>
 *   <groupId>org.postgresql</groupId>
 *   <artifactId>postgresql</artifactId>  
 *  <version>42.2.20</version>
 * </dependency>
 * }</pre>
 *
 * or in a Gradle build script (build.gradle), you would add:
 * 
 * <pre>{@code 
 * dependencies {
 *  runtimeOnly 'org.postgresql:postgresql:42.2.20'
 * } 
 * }</pre>
 * 
 * <p>
 * Always adjust the JDBC URL, user, and password according to your database
 * setup. Adjust the version numbers according to your project requirements and
 * the
 * latest available versions. Ensure that the database is running and accessible
 * when you run the
 * application.
 * <p>
 * This application is a simple demonstration of how to use JPA with Hibernate
 * to perform basic CRUD operations on an entity. It is intended for educational
 * purposes and to provide a starting point for working with JPA in Java
 * applications.
 * <p>
 * Note: The code provided here is a basic example and does not include error
 * handling or advanced features such as transaction management, caching, or
 * query optimization. In a production application, you would want to implement
 * proper error handling, logging, and possibly use a more sophisticated
 * configuration for your persistence unit.
 * <p>
 * This code is provided as-is and is intended for educational purposes.
 * It is recommended to refer to the official JPA and Hibernate documentation
 * for more detailed information and best practices when working with JPA in
 * Java applications.
 * <p>
 * To execute and test the various methods in this class, you can
 * uncomment the corresponding method calls in the main method. Each method
 * demonstrates a different aspect of JPA entity management, such as creating,
 * finding, updating, detaching, reattaching, and removing entities.
 * You can run the application to see how each method works and observe the
 * output in the console.
