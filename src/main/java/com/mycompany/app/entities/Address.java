/**
 * Represents an address with street, city, and postal code.
 * 
 * This class is marked as @Embeddable, which means it can be used as a
 * component of another entity. It does not have its own identity and is
 * typically used to encapsulate address-related fields within an entity.
 * 
 * Example usage:
 * <pre>
 * @Entity
 * public class User {
 *     @Id
 *     private Long id;
 *     private String name;
 *    
 *     @Embedded
 *     private Address address;
 *
 *     // getters and setters
 *     public Address getAddress() {
 *         return address;
 *     }
 *     public void setAddress(Address address) { 
 *        this.address = address;
 *     }
 * </pre>
