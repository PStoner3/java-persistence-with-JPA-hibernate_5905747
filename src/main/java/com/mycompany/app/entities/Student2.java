/**
 * Represents a student entity in the system.
 * Inherits common member attributes from the Member class.
 * 
 * This class is mapped to the "student" table in the database.
 * It contains a specific attribute for student code,
 * which is unique to the Student entity.
 * 
 * The @Entity annotation indicates that this class is a JPA entity,
 * and the @DiscriminatorColumn annotation specifies the column used
 * to distinguish between different member types in the single table inheritance
 * strategy.
 * 
 * This class is part of a single table inheritance strategy,
 * where all member types (like Teacher2 and Student2) are stored in a single
 * table.
 * The discriminator column helps to identify the type of each member record.
 * 
 * This class extends the Member2 class, inheriting its properties and behavior.
